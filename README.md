DevR’Us is a networking application that provides an outlet where developers can create networking events, communicate with other developers, and find upcoming events.

•	My core responsibilities were the front end and the back end of the application, the co-project manager, and I also was one of the presenters to the class.

•	HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, React, Node.js, MySql, Sequalize, Material-UI and Firebase to build the application.
